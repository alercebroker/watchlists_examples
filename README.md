# watchlists_examples
Examples of watchlists for the broker

1. List of object identifiers, check which of them have recent detections
- Run watchlists_oids.ipynb to obtain a list of oids with recent detections as output (requires a list of oids as input)
- Run watchlists_oids_lc.ipynb to read the list of oids (obtained with watchlists_oids_lc.ipynb) and plot light curves for objects in that list

2. List of coordinates and search radii, check if there are objects matching a cone search
- Run watchlists_coords.ipynb to obtain both a list of oids matching a cone search and a list of oids with recent detections as outputs (requires a list of coordinates and search radii as input)

Work in progress...
