# watchlists_examples
Examples of watchlists for the broker

1. List of object identifiers, check which of them have recent detections
- Run watchlists_oids.ipynb to obtain a list of oids with recent detections as output (requires a list of oids as input)
- Run watchlists_oids_lc.ipynb to read the list of oids (obtained with watchlists_oids_lc.ipynb) and plot light curves for objects in that list

Work in progress...
